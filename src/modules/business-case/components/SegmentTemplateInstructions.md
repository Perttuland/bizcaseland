# Customer Segment Template Instructions

## Purpose
Add a new customer segment to an existing business case. This will be MERGED with your current data - existing segments, pricing, and costs remain unchanged.

## Instructions for AI Tools
When filling this template:
1. Replace all TODO items with actual values for the new segment
2. Each field must have: value (number), unit (string), and rationale (explanation)  
3. Choose ONE volume pattern: geometric_growth, linear_growth, or seasonal_growth
4. The segment 'id' must be unique (e.g., 'enterprise', 'smb', 'government')
5. Set rationale fields to explain assumptions clearly

## Volume Growth Patterns

### Geometric Growth (Compound Percentage)
**Use when:** Growth compounds over time (viral products, network effects)
```json
"volume": {
  "base_value": 50,
  "unit": "customers_per_month",
  "pattern_type": "geometric_growth",
  "growth_rate": 0.15,
  "rationale": "Starting with 50 enterprise customers from pilot program",
  "growth_rationale": "15% monthly compound growth driven by digital marketing and customer referrals"
}
```
**Result:** Month 1: 50 ‚Üí Month 2: 57.5 ‚Üí Month 3: 66.1...

### Linear Growth (Fixed Increment)
**Use when:** Steady, predictable additions (direct sales, capacity-constrained)
```json
"volume": {
  "base_value": 25,
  "unit": "customers_per_month",
  "pattern_type": "linear_growth",
  "growth_rate": 10,
  "rationale": "Starting with 25 SMB customers from early adopter program",
  "growth_rationale": "Adding 10 new customers monthly through 3-person direct sales team"
}
```
**Result:** Month 1: 25 ‚Üí Month 2: 35 ‚Üí Month 3: 45...

### Seasonal Growth (Year-over-Year with Patterns)
**Use when:** Business has seasonal peaks/troughs (retail, B2B annual budgets)
```json
"volume": {
  "base_value": 100,
  "unit": "customers_per_month",
  "pattern_type": "seasonal_growth",
  "growth_rate": 0.20,
  "rationale": "Starting with 100 retail customers",
  "growth_rationale": "20% YoY growth with seasonal peaks in Q4 holiday season"
}
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Scope**: This template ONLY adds customer segments. Pricing, OpEx, and CapEx from your existing business case remain unchanged.

üí° **Update vs Add**: If you use an existing segment `id`, it will UPDATE that segment instead of adding a new one.

‚úì **Shared Economics**: All segments in your business case share the same:
- Pricing (avg_unit_price)
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS %)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Operating Expenses (OpEx)
- Capital Expenses (CapEx)

## Complete Template Structure

```json
{
  "assumptions": {
    "customers": {
      "segments": [
        {
          "id": "TODO_unique_segment_id",
          "label": "TODO: Segment Name",
          "name": "TODO: Display Name",
          "rationale": "TODO: Why this segment matters and how it differs",
          "volume": {
            "base_value": 0,
            "unit": "customers_per_month",
            "rationale": "TODO: Starting customer count explanation",
            "pattern_type": "geometric_growth|linear_growth|seasonal_growth",
            "growth_rate": 0.10,
            "growth_rationale": "TODO: Expected growth explanation"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Choose appropriate growth pattern for your use case
4. Paste completed JSON in "Modify Segment Data" tab
