# Test Cases for Bug Fixes

## Bug Fix Verification Checklist

### 1. Navigation Fix ✅
**Issue**: Homepage navigation buttons returned 404 for market analysis
**Fix**: Updated LandingPage.tsx navigation paths from `/business-case` and `/market-analysis` to `/business` and `/market`
**Test**: 
- [ ] Click "Start Market Research" on homepage → should navigate to `/market` 
- [ ] Click "Start Business Case" on homepage → should navigate to `/business`

### 2. Data Management Tab Access ✅
**Issue**: Data management tabs automatically switched away when data was loaded, preventing user access
**Fix**: Modified tab switching logic to only auto-switch on initial data load, not when user manually navigates back
**Test Business Case**:
- [ ] Load sample data → should auto-switch to Cash Flow tab
- [ ] Manually click "Data Management" tab → should stay on Data Management tab
- [ ] Load new data while on Data Management tab → should remain on Data Management tab

**Test Market Analysis**:
- [ ] Load sample data → should auto-switch to Overview tab  
- [ ] Manually click "Data Management" tab → should stay on Data Management tab
- [ ] Load new data while on Data Management tab → should remain on Data Management tab

### 3. Button Text Updates ✅
**Issue**: Navigation buttons should show "Continue" when data is loaded
**Fix**: Logic was already correct in LandingPage.tsx using `hasBusinessData` and `hasMarketData` state
**Test**:
- [ ] Fresh app load → buttons show "Start Business Case" and "Start Market Research"
- [ ] Load business case data → button shows "Continue Business Case"
- [ ] Load market analysis data → button shows "Continue Market Analysis"

### 4. Sample Data Organization ✅
**Issue**: Test data was disorganized and limited
**Fix**: Created structured `sample-data/` directory with comprehensive datasets
**New Structure**:
```
sample-data/
├── business-cases/
│   ├── saas-platform-revenue-growth.json
│   ├── iot-product-launch.json  
│   ├── fintech-market-entry.json
│   └── payroll-automation-cost-savings.json
├── market-analysis/
│   ├── ev-charging-market.json
│   └── healthcare-ai-analytics.json
└── README.md
```
