# Cross-Tool Data Integration Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation of **cross-tool data transfer** functionality, establishing the first true link between Market Analysis and Business Case tools. The solution preserves data provenance, provides user control, and creates a scalable foundation for future integrations.

## Architectural Decision: Data Source Layers

After systematic analysis through multiple approaches, we've implemented a **Data Source Layer Architecture** that provides:

1. **Full Traceability**: Every data point knows its origin
2. **User Control**: Users can switch between data sources at will
3. **No Data Loss**: All sources are preserved, including user input
4. **Clear UX**: Visual indicators show what data is active and where it came from

## Core Components

### 1. Data Source Tracking (`cross-tool-integration.ts`)

```typescript
interface SourcedBusinessAssumption {
  // Active value used in calculations
  value: number;
  unit: string;
  rationale: string;
  
  // Source management
  active_source: 'user_input' | 'market_analysis' | 'external_api';
  sources: {
    market_analysis?: {
      data: { value, unit, rationale };
      source_metadata: DataSource;
      user_accepted: boolean;
      user_modified: boolean;
    };
    user_input?: { /* similar structure */ };
  };
  
  // Sync status tracking
  sync_status: 'current' | 'stale' | 'conflict';
}
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Reversible**: Can always go back to user input
- **Auditable**: Full history of where data came from
- **Flexible**: Easy to add new data sources (competitive intelligence, external APIs)

### 2. Cross-Tool Transfer Service

```typescript
class CrossToolDataService {
  // Transfer market volume to business case
  static transferMarketVolume(marketData, targetSegment, options)
  
  // Switch between data sources  
  static switchDataSource(assumption, targetSource)
  
  // Validate alignment between tools
  static validateAlignment(businessAssumption, currentMarketData)
}
```

**Smart Transfer Logic:**
- Extracts volume projections from TAM/SAM/SOM analysis
- Calculates confidence scores based on data completeness
- Preserves user data while adding market-based alternative
- Provides clear rationale linking back to market analysis

### 3. User Interface Components

#### Market Analysis Side (`MarketToBusinessTransfer`)
- Shows volume projection preview
- Confidence level indicator
- Target segment selection
- User notes for context
- Clear transfer action

#### Business Case Side (`DataSourceManager`)
- Source switching controls
- Sync status indicators
- Data provenance display
- History and audit trail

## Data Flow Example

```
1. Market Analyst completes TAM/SAM/SOM analysis
   TAM: €2.5M, SAM: 60%, SOM: 30%, Target Share: 10%
   → Projected Volume: 45,000 units/year

2. User clicks "Transfer to Business Case"
   → Opens dialog with target segment selection
   → User adds notes: "Conservative estimate based on competitive analysis"

3. Transfer creates SourcedBusinessAssumption:
   {
     value: 45000,
     unit: "units_per_year", 
     active_source: "market_analysis",
     sources: {
       market_analysis: {
         data: { value: 45000, rationale: "Derived from TAM analysis..." },
         user_accepted: false, // Requires user approval
         confidence_score: 0.85
       },
       user_input: {
         data: { value: 0, rationale: "User input placeholder" },
         preserved: true // Original user data preserved
       }
     }
   }

4. Business Case shows data with source indicator
   → User can switch between "Market Analysis" and "User Input"
   → Clear visual showing this is market-derived data
   → Warning if market data becomes stale
```

## User Experience Design

### Market Analysis Tool Integration

**Status Panel:**
- ✅ TAM Analysis Complete
- ✅ SAM Analysis Complete  
- ✅ Market Share Strategy Complete
- 🎯 **Ready to Transfer:** 45,000 units projected

**Transfer Button:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚀 Send to Business Case            │
│                                     │
│ Projected Volume: 45,000 units      │
│ Confidence: HIGH                    │
│ Based on: TAM/SAM/SOM analysis      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Business Case Tool Integration

**Data Source Switcher:**
```
Volume Assumption: 45,000 units/year

Data Source: [Market Analysis ▼] [User Input] [History]
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sync Status: ✅ Current | ⚠️ Stale | ❌ Conflict

Rationale: "Derived from market analysis 'SaaS Platform Study'. 
TAM: €2.5M × 10% target share = 45,000 units/year"

💡 This data came from market analysis and can be switched back to user input at any time.
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Data Integrity & Traceability**
- Every assumption knows its source
- Full audit trail of data changes
- No "black box" calculations

### 2. **User Control & Trust**
- Users explicitly accept transferred data
- Can switch back to manual input anytime
- Clear indicators of data source

### 3. **Automated Validation**
- Confidence scoring for transferred data
- Alignment warnings when data diverges
- Stale data detection

### 4. **Scalable Architecture**
- Template for future cross-tool integrations
- Supports multiple data sources per field
- Event-driven updates

## Implementation Impact

### For Market Analysts
```
Before: "I did this great market analysis but now I have to manually 
        tell the business case person what volumes to use"

After:  "Market analysis complete → Click 'Send to Business Case' → 
        Volumes automatically transferred with full context"
```

### For Business Case Developers  
```
Before: "Someone gave me volume assumptions but I don't know where 
        they came from or how current they are"

After:  "I can see this volume came from 'SaaS Platform Market Analysis' 
        on March 15th with 85% confidence. I can switch back to my 
        estimates if needed."
```

### For Executives
```
Before: "Are the business case volumes realistic? How do they relate 
        to the market research?"

After:  "The business case uses market-validated volumes with clear 
        alignment scores and confidence indicators."
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Storage Strategy
- Enhanced BusinessData structure supports sourced assumptions
- Backwards compatible with existing JSON data
- Graceful degradation if source data unavailable

### Error Handling
- Validation before transfer (insufficient market data)
- User confirmation for destructive operations
- Clear error messages with suggested actions

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of source history
- Efficient sync status calculation  
- Minimal impact on existing tool performance

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

- **Auto-Sync**: Automatically update when market data changes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merging of competing data sources

### Phase 3: Extended Integrations
