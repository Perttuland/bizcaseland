## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Market Analysis
- Open the application in your browser
- Click on "Market Analysis" from the landing page
- Or navigate directly to `/market`

### 3. Load Sample Data
- If no data is loaded, you'll see the data input screen
- Click "Load Sample Data" button to load comprehensive market analysis data
- The app will automatically switch to the Overview tab

### 4. Open Assumptions Tab
- Click on the "Assumptions" tab in the navigation
- You should see:
  - Statistics dashboard (Total Assumptions, Sensitivity Drivers, Categories)
  - Legend card explaining UI elements
  - Category cards for Market Sizing, Market Share, etc.

### 5. Test Value Editing
1. **Edit a currency value**:
   - Find "TAM Base Value" under Market Sizing
   - Click on the value
   - Enter a new number (e.g., "60000000")
   - Press Enter or click outside
   - Value should update immediately

2. **Edit a percentage value**:
   - Find "TAM Growth Rate" under Market Sizing
   - Click on the value (shows as percentage, e.g., "12.0%")
   - Enter a new percentage (e.g., "15")
   - Press Enter
   - Value should update to "15.0%"

### 6. Test Rationale Editing
1. Click on any rationale text
2. Edit the text in the textarea
3. Press Ctrl+Enter or click outside
4. Text should update immediately

### 7. Test Red Indicator System
1. Edit a value (e.g., change TAM Growth Rate)
2. Rationale text should turn RED
3. Click on the rationale to edit it
4. Update the rationale text
5. Save the rationale
6. RED indicator should disappear

### 8. Test Sensitivity Driver Management
1. **Add a driver**:
   - Check the checkbox next to "TAM Base Value"
   - Orange "S" badge should appear next to the label
   - Statistics dashboard should show "1" under Sensitivity Drivers

2. **Edit driver range**:
   - Click on the orange "S" badge
   - Popover opens with 5 input fields
   - Edit the values (e.g., Very Low: 40000000, Low: 45000000, Base: 50000000, High: 55000000, Very High: 60000000)
   - Click "Save Range"
   - Popover closes

3. **Remove a driver**:
   - Click on the "S" badge again
   - Click "Remove Driver" button
   - Badge should disappear
   - Statistics dashboard should show "0" under Sensitivity Drivers

### 9. Test Data Persistence
1. Make several edits (values, rationales, add drivers)
2. Navigate to another tab (e.g., Overview)
3. Navigate back to Assumptions tab
4. All changes should still be there
5. Refresh the browser page (F5)
6. Navigate back to Market Analysis → Assumptions
7. All changes should still be persisted

### 10. Test with Different Data
1. Navigate to "Data Management" tab
2. Click "Clear Data" (if available)
3. Paste different market analysis JSON
4. Click "Load Data"
5. Navigate to Assumptions tab
6. Should show assumptions from the new data

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Tab doesn't appear
- **Solution**: Make sure market data is loaded first
- Navigate to Data Management tab and load sample data

### Issue: Values don't update
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors
- Verify localStorage is enabled in browser
- Try clearing browser cache

### Issue: Red indicators don't clear
- **Solution**: Make sure to actually edit the rationale text
- Press Ctrl+Enter or click outside to save
- Check that the rationale text is different after editing

### Issue: Drivers don't persist
- **Solution**: Verify that `marketData.drivers` array exists
- Check browser console for save errors
- Try refreshing after adding a driver

### Issue: Percentages display incorrectly
- **Solution**: The system automatically converts between ratio (0.10) and percentage (10%)
- When editing, you can enter either format
- Display will always show percentage format

## 🔍 Browser Console Checks

Open browser console (F12) and look for these messages:

### On value update:
```
Market assumption updated at path: market_sizing.total_addressable_market.base_value.value 60000000
```

### On driver add:
```
Market driver added: {key: "tam_base_value", label: "TAM Base Value", path: "...", range: [...], rationale: "..."}
```

### On driver remove:
```
Market driver removed: market_sizing.total_addressable_market.base_value
```

### On driver range update:
```
Market driver range updated: market_sizing.total_addressable_market.base_value [40000000, 45000000, 50000000, 55000000, 60000000]
```
