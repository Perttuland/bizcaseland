- ✅ Click on any value cell to edit
- ✅ Automatic type handling (currency, percentages, numbers)
- ✅ Real-time validation with error messages
- ✅ Save on Enter or blur, cancel on ESC
- ✅ Uses existing `EditableValueCell` component

### 2. Inline Rationale Editing
- ✅ Click on rationale text to edit
- ✅ Multi-line textarea support
- ✅ Red indicator when value changes but rationale doesn't update
- ✅ Indicator clears when rationale is updated
- ✅ Uses existing `EditableRationaleCell` component

### 4. Data Organization
- ✅ Grouped by category: Market Sizing, Market Share, Competitive Intelligence, Customer Analysis
- ✅ Sub-grouped by subcategory (e.g., TAM, SAM, SOM within Market Sizing)
- ✅ Clean table layout with consistent styling
- ✅ Statistics dashboard showing total assumptions, drivers, and categories

### 5. Data Persistence
- ✅ All changes auto-save to localStorage via AppContext
- ✅ Changes sync across tabs
- ✅ Drivers stored in `marketData.drivers` array
- ✅ Updates use safe nested operations from `nested-operations.ts`

---

## 📊 Editable Assumptions Covered

### Market Sizing
- TAM Base Value
- TAM Growth Rate
- SAM % of TAM
- SOM % of SAM

### Market Share
- Current Market Share
- Current Revenue
- Target Market Share
- Target Timeframe

### Competitive Intelligence
- Each Competitor's Market Share (dynamic array)

### Customer Analysis
- Each Segment's Size Percentage (dynamic array)
- Each Segment's Size Value (dynamic array)
- Each Segment's Growth Rate (dynamic array)

---

## 🔄 Integration Points

### With Existing Components
- **EditableValueCell**: Handles all numeric value editing
- **EditableRationaleCell**: Handles all text rationale editing
- **SensitivityDriverBadge**: Manages driver range editing
- **value-parsers.ts**: Parses and formats values based on unit type

### With Context
- **AppContext**: Provides market data state and update methods
- **updateMarketAssumption**: Uses `setNestedValue` for safe deep updates
- **Driver methods**: Manage sensitivity driver array in market data

### With Market Analysis Suite
- Seamlessly integrated as new tab in existing tab system
- Positioned between "Strategic Planning" and "Data Management"
- Uses same styling and layout conventions

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Path Generation
Paths follow the market data structure:
```typescript
'market_sizing.total_addressable_market.base_value.value'
'market_sizing.total_addressable_market.growth_rate.value'
'competitive_landscape.competitors[0].market_share.value'
'customer_analysis.market_segments[0].size_percentage.value'
```

### Value Update Flow
1. User edits value in `EditableValueCell`
2. Component calls `handleValueUpdate(path, value)`
3. Path is marked as "changed" (for red indicator)
4. `updateMarketAssumption` called on AppContext
5. Uses `setNestedValue` to safely update nested object
6. Updated data saved to localStorage
7. React re-renders with new value

### Rationale Update Flow
1. User edits rationale in `EditableRationaleCell`
2. Component calls `handleRationaleUpdate(path, value)`
3. Path removed from "changed" set (clears red indicator)
4. `updateMarketAssumption` called on AppContext
5. Updated rationale saved to localStorage
6. React re-renders without red indicator

### Driver Management Flow
1. User checks checkbox to add driver
2. `addMarketDriver` called with path, label, default range, rationale
3. New driver added to `marketData.drivers` array
4. Component re-renders showing "S" badge
5. User clicks badge to edit range
6. `updateMarketDriverRange` called with new range values
7. Driver array updated in localStorage

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Navigate to Market Analysis Suite
2. Load market data (via Data Management tab or sample data)
3. Click on "Assumptions" tab
4. Click any value to edit it inline
5. Click any rationale to update it
6. Check checkbox to add as sensitivity driver
7. Click "S" badge to edit driver range
8. All changes auto-save

### For Developers
- Market assumptions extracted via `extractMarketAssumptions(marketData)`
- Uses same value parsers as business case assumptions
- Reuses all existing editable components
- Extends AppContext with market-specific methods
- Follows same patterns as BusinessDataContext
