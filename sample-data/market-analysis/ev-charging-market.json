Their highway corridor focus and 350kW ultra-fast charging capabilities set the technical benchmark. However, their premium pricing strategy (€0.79/kWh) and limited network density outside highways create significant market gaps, particularly in urban commercial and retail segments.\n\nWe'll avoid direct competition in the premium highway segment and instead focus on underserved commercial fleet and retail destination charging markets where Ionity has minimal presence. Our competitive pricing (targeting €0.45-0.55/kWh) and revenue-sharing partnerships enable profitable operation in locations where Ionity's premium model doesn't work. We'll position as the smart, affordable alternative for everyday charging versus Ionity's premium long-distance positioning."

Our advanced grid integration technology delivers consistent charging performance and lower operational costs. We'll target Allego's commercial customers with demonstrated TCO advantages and seamless fleet management integration. Our consumer-grade mobile app experience appeals to retail partners seeking to enhance customer satisfaction, an area where Allego's B2B-first approach shows clear weaknesses."

Their integrated payment systems and retail customer relationships offer natural EV charging extension opportunities. However, their late market entry and legacy fossil fuel focus create technology gaps and cultural challenges in embracing pure-play electric mobility innovation.\n\nWe'll exploit Shell's technology weaknesses through superior smart charging capabilities and pure-play EV focus. While Shell treats charging as an adjacency to fuel retail, we're building EV charging as core business with purpose-built technology. Our flexible partnership model allows us to move faster than Shell's corporate bureaucracy. We'll target innovative retail and hospitality partners who want cutting-edge charging solutions rather than Shell's adequate-but-unexceptional offering. Our EV-native culture and rapid innovation cycles appeal to forward-thinking partners frustrated with Shell's legacy energy company pace."
