These are typically university-affiliated teaching hospitals with research missions. Decision-makers include Chief Medical Information Officers (CMIOs), Chief Innovation Officers, and hospital CEOs, with complex procurement involving clinical, IT, and administrative stakeholders. Budget cycles are annual with multi-year strategic technology planning.",

There's a critical unmet need for AI-driven predictive analytics to improve clinical outcomes while reducing costly adverse events and readmissions. Current analytics tools lack the sophistication to handle real-time clinical decision support at scale. Hospitals struggle to demonstrate value-based care performance and need actionable insights from population health data. Integration challenges with legacy EHR systems and lack of interoperability prevent effective data utilization. Regulatory compliance requirements (GDPR, MDR) and clinical validation standards create significant barriers to AI adoption.",
